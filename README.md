# This is still largely a work in progress.

This is my first experience with a project bigger than a couple dozen lines in one script (excluding my previous attempt at making a bot).
At this point in time, the code is somewhat of mess and quite lacking in terms of features (there isn't even really any error-checking), but I'm actively working on it.

The main thing is, it works, even though it's a mess.

## List of things yet to be implemented:

- [ ] Deleting temp files!!!
- [ ] Error-checking and handling
- [ ] Naming, sorting out functions and files...
- [ ] (Slash) Commands
- [ ] 'Apps' context menu actions (for transcribing older messages)
- [ ] Settings and how to store them
- [ ] Customization (what to show in the footer, a "funny message", stats or nothing)
- [ ] Figuring out what to do with the config (generate it through code or include a file)
- [ ] Stats (and, again, storing them)
- [ ] more?
